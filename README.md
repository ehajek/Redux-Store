# Redux-Store

This is a workup of the Redux Shop Engine. 
The project plan is to follow the following criteria; 

    GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
    WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
    THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
    WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
    THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
    WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
    THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
    WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
    THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
    WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
    THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
